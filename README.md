This repository showcases a subtle bug in Elixir related to the unexpected termination of an `Enum.each` loop due to a `Process.exit` call within the loop's function. The bug is demonstrated in `bug.exs`, and a solution is provided in `bugSolution.exs`.  The core problem is that `Enum.each` doesn't inherently handle exceptions or process termination gracefully; it simply stops execution. The solution employs more robust error handling techniques.
